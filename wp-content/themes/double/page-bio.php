                    Four young men from West Philadelphia come together for the first time as United Image.  “We were all just crazy about harmony,” Leonard “Butch” Davis explains. “We had a great deal of admiration for each other’s talents. And that made it easy for us to begin to want to work together.”  
                    (Joe, do you have an old photo of at least you and Butch from the 60’s? These photos will be a treat for your fans and a validation of your long personal relationship and passion for entertaining/singing.)
                    Over the following years, the group was frequently booked for local shows.  Early gigs for the group included weddings, birthday and anniversary parties, local night clubs and shows in the Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware  areas, as well as the NYC and DC areas. The group continued to modernize the Covers of the Intruders, the Delphonics, and, the Motown staple of soul groups, the Miracles, the Temptations and the Four Tops.
